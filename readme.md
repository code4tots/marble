(marble) programming language
------------------------------

Interpreted language with semantics like javascript or Python, but with
syntax like LISP for code as data stuff.

Right now the interpreter is essentially just one Python script.

Planning on adding stuff to it. Perhaps if it gets interesting enough, I
might do a rewrite in C.
